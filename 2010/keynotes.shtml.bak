<b>How SBSE Can Support Construction and Analysis of Predictive Models</b>
<ul>
<li>
Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an approach to software
engineering in which search based optimization algorithms are used to
identify optimal or near optimal solutions and to yield insight.
<li>
SBSE
techniques can cater for multiple, possibly completing objectives and/ or
constraints and applications where the potential solution space is large
and complex.
<li>
This talk will provide a brief overview of SBSE, explaining
some of the ways in which it has already been applied to construction of
predictive models. There is a mutually beneficial relationship between
predictive models and SBSE. The talk will outline some novel ways in which
SBSE might be used for predictive model construction and how predictive
models also have role to play in improving SBSE.
</ul>
