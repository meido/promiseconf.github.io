<p>
Following on from this meeting, there will be a special issue
in the Empirical Software Engineering Journal on 
"Inventing the next generation of software analytics".

<p>
This special issue will ask authors
to comment on the success and failings of software analytics
over the last 20 years and will ask
"what and how can we do it better in future?". It is encouraged,
but not mandatory that authors 
explore the ethical issues raised in our CFP.

<p>The special issue will have the same guest editors as the co-PC chairs
of this conferences. Where possible, that special issue will also try to
use the same reviewers as PROMISE'20. The special issue will be open to
the entire SE community.

  <a name=about><h3>About</h3></a>
<p>  Welcome to the 16th Annual PROMISE Conference on Analytics in
  Software Engineering.
For nearly two decades, PROMISE has lead the SE field in open science.
We place a high premium on reproducible research
that can be repeated and/or improved and/or refuted by other researchers.
Hence we ask that, where possible, PROMISE authors publicly share their
tools and data.  

<p>The theme for this year's conference is <u>Ethical AI</u>:  
<ul>
<li>
AI-for-SE tools 
are usually
assessed  via the predictive performance of the models they create (accuracy, recall, etc).
<li>
But now, groups like
the
IEEE,
the European Commission on AI,
and large corporations like Microsoft are demanding we consider other criteria
that address ethical concerns.
</ul>
<p>
So our  question for  PROMISE'20 is:
<ul><em>
Can we now apply and adjust our AI-for-SE tools (including predictive models)
to handle ethical non-functional requirements such as
inclusiveness, transparency, oversight and accountability,
privacy, security, reliability, safety, diversity and fairness? 
</em></ul>
<p>(For some notes on these ethical non-functional requirements,
see our <a href="#references">references</a> section.)
<p>
<p>To support this theme, we have invited keynote speakers to address
these broader issues of AI-for-SE tools. Also, we are planning a lively "fish-bowl panel"
for this meeting where all participants can comment on ethics and AI-for-SE.

<a name="keynotes"><h3>Keynote Speakers</h3></a>

<img width=120 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/bellamy.png">
<p><b>Rachel Bellamy</b>, IBM Research, NY<br>
<em>Fair AI in Practice</em>
<p>
Fairness is an increasingly important concern as machine learning
models are used to support decision making in high-stakes applications
such as mortgage lending, hiring, and prison sentencing. This talk
will introduce an open source Python toolkit for algorithmic fairness,
AI Fairness 360 (AIF360). The main objectives of this toolkit are
to help facilitate the transition of fairness research algorithms
to use in an industrial setting and to provide a common framework
for fairness researchers to share and evaluate algorithms.
 <p><em>Dr. Bellamy  is a Principle Research Scientist and manages
 the Human-AI Collaboration group at IBM T J Watson Research Center,
 Yorktown Heights, New York

Her team is currently working on the user experience for several
of IBM's AI projects, including the AI Fairness 360 toolkit
and rule-based machine-teaching for Watson Assistant. Rachel received
her doctorate in cognitive psychology from University of Cambridge,
UK in 1991. She holds many patents and has published more
than 70 research papers. For more, see her

<b>Lionel Briand</b>, U.Ottawa, Canada<br>
<em>Natural Lanaguage Processing and Software Requirements</em>
<p>
Abstract, to be confirmed.

 <p><em>
 Lionel C. Briand is professor of software engineering and has
 shared appointments between (1) The University of Ottawa, Canada
 and (2) The SnT centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust,
 University of Luxembourg. One of the founders of
 the 
 ICST conferencea
ge was also EiC of Empirical Software
 Engineering (Springer) for 13 years.
 Lionel was elevated to the grade of IEEE Fellow in 2010 for his
 work on testing object-oriented systems. He received an ERC
 Advanced grant in 2016- on the topic of modelling and testing
 cyber-physical systems- which is the most prestigious individual
 research award in the European Union. Most recently, he was awarded
 a Canada Research Chair (Tier 1) on "Intelligent Software Dependability
 and Compliance". His research interests include: software testing
 and verification, model-driven software development, applications
 of AI in software engineering, and empirical software engineering.

<a name=cfp><h3>Call for Papers</h3></a>
<p>
<img width=120 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/cfp.png">
Historically, this conference has
focused on predictive modeling  and as that field has matured and broadened,
PROMISE now accepts a wide range of papers where AI tools have been applied to SE.

<p>We invite theory and empirical studies on the topics of interest
(e.g. case studies, meta-analysis, replications, experiments,
simulations, surveys etc.), as well as industrial experience reports
detailing the application of AI-for-SE (including predictive modeling)
in industrial settings. 
It is encouraged,
but not mandatory, that somewhere in their paper
authors make some comment about the question posed above:
<ul><em>
Can we now apply and adjust our AI-for-SE tools (including predictive models)
to handle ethical non-functional requirements such as
inclusiveness, transparency, oversight and accountability,
privacy, security, reliability, safety, diversity and fairness? 
</em></ul>
<p>(For some notes on these ethical non-functional requirements,
see our <a href="#references">references</a> section.)

<p>
Both positive and negative results are
welcome, though negative results should still be based on rigorous
research and provide details on lessons learned. 
Submissions can be of the following
kinds:

<ul>
<li>
Full papers: papers with novel and complete results.
<li>
Short papers: papers to disseminate on-going work and preliminary results for early feedback, or vision papers about the future of 
AI-for-SE tools (including predictive modeling).
</ul>
<p>
PROMISE accepts theory or application papers. We also accept
<em>data-oriented</em> papers where some new curated data set is presented (without our without baseline results).
Such data-oriented papers can discuss the tools or frameworks or metrics that make this data usable and meaningful
(or hard to use and meaningless).
Also accepted are <em>validity-oriented</em> papers that reproduce/refute prior results
or discuss the complexities associated with such reproduction/refutation studies.
<p>
PROMISE places a high premium on open science and reproducible research
that can be verified and/or improved and/or refuted.
Hence we ask that, where possible, researchers publicly share their
tools and data.  Similar to other
leading SE conferences, PROMISE supports and encourages Green Open
Access, i.e., self-archiving. Authors can archive their papers on
their personal home page, an institutional repository of their
employer, or at an e-print server such as arXiv (preferred).
Also, given that PROMISE papers heavily rely on software
data, we would like to draw authors that leverage data scraped from
GitHub of GitHub's Terms of Service, which require that "publications
resulting from that research are open access". 

<img width=80 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/acm.png">
	<p>Accepted papers will be published in the ACM
	Digital Library within its International Conference Proceedings
	Series and will be available electronically via ACM Digital
	Library. 

	<p>Each accepted paper needs to have one registration
	at the full conference rate and be presented in person at
	the conference.

    <hr>
	<a name=submit><h3>Submission (Double-Blind)</h3></a>
<p>
<img align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/cfp1.png">
	PROMISE 2019 submissions must meet the following criteria:
	<ul>
	<lI>Be original work, not published or under review elsewhere while being considered;
	<li>Conform to the ACM SIG proceedings template;
	<li>Not exceed 10 (4) pages for full (short) papers including references;
	<li>Be written in English;
	<li>Be prepared for double blind review 
          <ul><li>Exception: for data-oriented papers, authors
            may elect not to use double blind by placing a footnote on page1 saying "Offered for single-blind review".</ul>
	<li>Be submitted via EasyChair (please choose the paper category appropriately; i.e. either long or short).
	</ul>
	<p>
	Submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three experts
	from the international program committee. Submissions will
	be evaluated on the basis of their originality, importance
	of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality, and
	consistency of presentation, and appropriate comparison to
	related work.
