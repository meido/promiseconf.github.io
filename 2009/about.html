            <p class="blk_heading">The PROMISE conference leverages the successful experience from the  four previous workshops. The objective of the conference is to deliver  to the software engineering community useful, usable, verifiable, and  repeatable models applicable to better manage software processes and  projects.</p>
            <span class="blk_heading">To this end, we: <br />
            </span>

              <li class="blk_heading"> Maintain an on-line repository where researchers and practitioners  can store the data they use to make their conclusions, access models  and data used by other researchers and practitioners, and compare their  results to those obtained in previous work.<br />
              </li>
              <li><span class="blk_heading"> Hold an annual conference where researchers and practitioners  can meet to discuss and refine their results and methods, and to  describe repeatable experiments in software engineering <br />

            </ul>            
            <p class="blk_heading">The PROMISE conference provides an annual forum for researchers and  practitioners to present and exchange ideas, results, and experiences  with predictor models that are applicable to implementation,  evaluation, and management of software processes and projects. A key  objective of PROMISE is to help establish verifiable and repeatable  models that are useful to the software engineering community.</p>
            <p class="blk_heading">Traditionally, PROMISE meetings have focused on effort and defect  prediction. For 2009, PROMISE is expanding its traditional scope to  include topics such as model-based requirements engineering and  value-based software engineering. We encourage submissions that extend  the idea of PROMISE to many more fields of software engineering.</p>

            <p class="blk_heading">The PROMISE on-line repository provides researchers and  practitioners a central location where they can store the data they use  to make their conclusions, and access models and data used by other  researchers and practitioners, The repository now contains 76 data  sets, which can be used to repeat/confirm/refute/improve previous  results. Conference attendees are encouraged to provide their datasets  to the PROMISE repository, to be used for experiments and as benchmarks  by other researchers.</p>
            <p class="blk_heading">PROMISE 2009 gives the highest priority to case studies, experience  reports, and presented results that are based on publicly available  datasets. To increase the chance of acceptance, authors are urged to  submit papers that use such datasets. Data can come from anywhere  including the conference Web site (<a href="http://promisedata.org/repository/" target="_blank">http://promisedata.org/repository/</a>).</p>
            <p class="blk_heading">Submissions should be five to ten pages long (max), and must be  original and previously unpublished. The details of the paper and data  submission process are available at <a href="http://promisedata.org/2009/cfp.html" target="_self">http://promisedata.org/2009/cfp.html</a></p>
            <p class="blk_heading">Papers will be reviewed by the program committee in terms of their  technical content and their relevance to the scope of the conference,  as well as their ability to stimulate discussion. At least one author  of an accepted paper is required to register and attend the conference. </p>
          <p class="blk_heading">Selected papers from prior PROMISE workshops appeared in IEEE  Software and the Empirical Software Engineering journal. Papers  presented at PROMISE 2009 will be submitted to the ACM digital library  and are eligible for submission to a special issue TBD. </p>            </td>
