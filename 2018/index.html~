<h2><span>Keynote: "Getting Defect Prediction into Industrial Practice: Just a Dream?"<p>by Prof. Tracy Hall, Lancaster University, UK </span></h2>
			<p>	
				<table>
				<tr valign="center"><td> <img height="300" width="200" src="./images/hall.jpg"></td>
<td><p><b>Abstract</b>: Despite many researchers over many years developing increasingly sophisticated defect prediction models there is little evidence that these models are being used by industry. This talk explores the possible reasons for this lack of industrial impact. The challenges of practitioners’ building reliable defect prediction models are discussed, as well as the commercial overhead of training models on high quality data. The talk goes on to consider whether the kinds of problems addressed by defect prediction researchers are high on industry’s agenda. Experiences with industrial collaborators are presented and ways forward for defect prediction are explored.
</p>

<p><b>Bio</b>: Tracy Hall is Professor of Software Engineering at Lancaster University in the UK. She was previously Professor of Software Engineering at Brunel University London and Head of Brunel’s Computer Science Department. Over the last 20 years Professor Hall has conducted many empirical software engineering studies with a variety of industrial collaborators. Her current research activities focus on software defect prediction and the development of tools for use by software engineers. She has published over 100 international peer reviewed journal and conference papers and has won numerous best paper awards. Professor Hall has been Principal Investigator on a variety of funded research projects. She is Associate Editor for the Information Software Technology Journal and the Software Quality Journal. She has contributed to a range of conference organising committees and is a long standing member of many international conference programme committees. </p></td></tr></table></p>

				<h2>Kinds of Papers</h2>
				<p>We invite theory and empirical studies on the topics of interest (e.g. case studies, meta-analysis, replications, experiments, simulations, surveys etc.), as well as industrial experience reports detailing the application of predictive modelling and data analytics in industrial settings. Both positive and negative results are welcome, though negative results should still be based on rigorous research and provide details on lessons learned. It is encouraged, but not mandatory, that conference attendees contribute the data used in their analysis on-line. Submissions can be of the following kinds:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Full papers (oral presentation): papers with novel and complete results.</li>
				<li>Short papers (oral presentation): papers to disseminate on-going work and preliminary results for early feedback, or vision papers about the future of predictive modelling and data analytics in software engineering</li>
				</ul>

				<b>Note about GitHub research:</b> Given that PROMISE papers heavily rely on software data, we would like to draw authors that leverage data scraped from GitHub of GitHub's Terms of Service, which require that “publications resulting from that research are open access”. Similar to other leading SE conferences, PROMISE supports and encourages Green Open Access, i.e., self-archiving. Authors can archive their papers on their personal home page, an institutional repository of their employer, or at an e-print server such as arXiv (preferred).
