<h1>AISE'12</h1>
<h2>First Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering</h2>

<h3>colocated with <a href="http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/icse2012/">ICSE 2012</a></h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The goal of this workshop is to promote discussion and debate on the application of computational intelligence techniques to the software engineering field as well as to open research directions across the AI and software engineering divide. In particular, we wish to stimulate discussion, thoughts and subsequent collaboration on the following themes applied to software engineering:
	<ul>
		<li>Software quality prediction</li>
		<li>Assessing the quality of datasets</li>
		<li>Knowledge representation and ontologies in software engineering</li>
		<li>Social network analyses</li>
		<li>The application of metaheurisitcs, data mining and fuzzy logic</li>
		<li>Bayesian Belief Networks</li>
		<li>System dynamics and simulation models</li>
		<li>Machine Learning</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Motivation and Relevance</h2>

During the past ten years or so, many researchers from the software engineering discipline have begun to apply computational intelligence and mathematical techniques to their research, including searching and optimization meta-heuristic techniques, data mining, fuzzy logic and probabilistic techniques such as Bayesian Belief Networks.  Problems such as planning and decision making in software engineering, finding patterns of defective modules, effort estimation, test case generation, knowledge extraction, etc. can often be reformulated using techniques which fall under the general umbrella of computational intelligence techniques This incremental adoption of techniques, which are already used extensively in AI, could provide more revolutionary advances if further interdisciplinary research were to be performed. This workshop will promote discussion and debate to stimulate such work.
<br />
A large number of decisions must be taken during the development and maintenance of any software system. For a project to be successful project managers need to estimate effort and size as accurately as possible, different architectures and designs need to be evaluated, and so on. During coding and testing there are also multiple decisions concerning intermediate artefacts. Computational intelligence techniques can help with the decision making process (for example, estimation and planning of projects) and with the generation of artefacts (for example, automating test case generation).
<br />
  Furthermore, there are currently multiple repositories of project data that can be used for estimation or corroboration of project management decisions. Modern development environments allow us to collect a large amount of data during the execution of a project concerning real-time decisions. The extraction of information from such large datasets or repositories is not however free of problems and how to deal with such problems is another topic of interest of this workshop.
<br />
This workshop will also provide a forum for discussion and debate on the application of knowledge representations and ontologies in computational science and the computational intelligence techniques used for the manipulation of such data. Examples of such work include: reasoning with software engineering ontologies; combining research from knowledge representation and data mining; analysis of social networks in software engineering; evaluation of social capital in social media networks;  financial computing with representations such as XBRL; software engineering and project management using computational intelligence, etc.

<h2>Paper Submission and Selection</h2>
Seven position papers will be chosen for short (i.e. 15 minute) presentations followed by approximately 10 minutes of critical discussion from the attendees. Position papers will be distributed to attendees prior to the workshop. Following the workshop the authors will be invited to extend their position papers into full journal papers, for a Special Issue of the <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/11219"><strong>Software Quality Journal</strong></a>.
<br />
Participation will be sought with the aim of encouraging a selection of about 30 colleagues from the academic, industrial and commercial communities. The minimum number of participants with which we can run the workshop is 12 (to ensure meaningful and fruitful discussions take place) and the maximum number is 35 (for logistical reasons).
<br /><br />
Please submit your position paper to both <a href="mailto:rachel.harrison@brookes.ac.uk">rachel.harrison@uah.es</a> and <a href="mailto:daniel.rodriguezg@uah.es">daniel.rodriguezg@uah.es</a>.

<h2>Programme</h2>

We will use an informal workshop style. Following   presentation of the position papers, the participants will be split into five Working Groups, and each will be given a specific question to focus on, taken from the workshop themes.
Each Working Group will prepare a short summary of their findings, which will then be presented to the whole group in a final plenary session.
