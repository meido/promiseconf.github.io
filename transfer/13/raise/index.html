<p>Transfer'13:  The International Workshop on Transfer Learning in SE
<br>San Francisco, USA
<br>Nov 11, 2013 (approx date)
<br>In association with the 28th  International Conference on Automated
Software Engineering.

<p>
ABOUT THE WORKSHOP
<p>
Why is generality so hard to find in software engineering?  Do such
general principles exist (and we just have not found them yet)? Or are
we doomed to a perpetual revision of all our coding and management
practices for each new project? On this issue, we can identify two
feuding schools of thought. Globalists and localists use different
strategies for learning best practices. Globalists learn lessons once
from all data then reuse those lessons at multiple sites, whereas
Localists learn best practices many times from local data and use them
only at a single site (which implies that project managers must devote
their scant resources to a "local lessons team'' that pursues best
local practices).
<p>
This workshop will focus on the following issue: Whose strategy is
best for finding project-specific best practices: the globalists or
the localists? Or perhaps it is best to combine both approaches. It is
certainly important to learn best practices from past projects.
However, it is just as important to know how to  transfer and adapt
that experience to current projects. No project is exactly like
previous projects- hence, the trick is to find which parts of the past
are most relevant and can be transferred into the current project.
<p>
Topics of interest are theoretical foundations and practical
approaches related, but not limited, to the integration of the
transfer learning and software engineering. While our focus in on
automatic methods, we are also interested in hybrid human/comptuer
methods.
